## BANANA LINGUAL, PRIME BIRTHDAY, LEAP YEAR
- This is a basic and fun translation app that translates what you write in the minion language.
- A translation api is used in this application.
- A user enters a paragraph which is then translated using the API and returned in the output box.
- Along with the translation app, I have created two more applications:
  - First is to check if the entered year is a leap year.
  - Second is to check if your birtdhay is a prime number.
- In the prime birthday application, I take the date as string by user input and then sliced it, removed the '-' from the string and made a number from the date.
- That date is then checked for prime number.
- Overall, learned basic javascript functionalities and functions which allowed me to have better JS fundamentals.
